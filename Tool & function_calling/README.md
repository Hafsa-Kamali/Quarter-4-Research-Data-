## 🚀 Overview

In the world of modern AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can do a lot — but they can't do **everything**. They lack real-time awareness, can’t access live data, or directly interact with external systems.

This is where **Tool Calling** and **Function Calling** come into play.

> Tool Calling empowers AI to interact with external tools (like APIs or calculators), while Function Calling is how the AI knows what tool to call, what inputs it needs, and how to get results.

Together, they let AI models:
- Fetch real-time weather
- Solve complex calculations
- Control smart devices
- Search the internet
- And much more...
