## 📘 Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand, generate, and interact using human language. They power tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and others used in writing, coding, answering questions, summarization, and much more.

---

## ⚙️ How LLMs Work

1. **Tokenization** – Breaks text into small pieces (tokens)
2. **Embeddings** – Converts tokens into numerical vectors
3. **Transformer Network** – Understands context using attention mechanisms
4. **Prediction** – Generates the next token in a sequence
5. **Output** – Produces human-readable responses

---

## 🏗️ Building an LLM

- **Data Collection**: Billions of words from books, web, code, etc.
- **Preprocessing**: Clean and format data
- **Training**: High-performance computing (GPUs/TPUs)
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy and task performance checks
- **Deployment**: Model is hosted and accessed via APIs or platforms

## 🔧 Core Features

### 🔄 Fine-Tuning
Customize a general model for specific tasks/domains using techniques like:
- Full model retraining
- LoRA (parameter-efficient)
- Prompt tuning

### 🛠️ Tool Calling (Function Calling)
Allows the model to:
- Call APIs
- Fetch real-time data
- Execute code/functions

### 🧭 Embeddings
Convert text into vectors for:
- Semantic search
- Q&A over documents
- Clustering and recommendations

### 🧠 Prompt Engineering
Crafting smart prompts to guide outputs:
- Zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought
- Role/system prompts

### 🔍 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Combines LLM with search/database to enhance accuracy using real-world data.

### 🖼️ Multimodal Capabilities
Some LLMs (like GPT-4V or Gemini) process images, audio, or video along with text.
