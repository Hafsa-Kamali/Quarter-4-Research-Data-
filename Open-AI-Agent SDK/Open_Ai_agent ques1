# Why is the `Agent` Class a Python Dataclass in OpenAI Agents SDK?

## Overview

The `Agent` class in the OpenAI Agents SDK is implemented as a Python dataclass. This design choice simplifies how agents are defined and managed within the SDK. This README explains the reasons and benefits behind using the `@dataclass` decorator for the `Agent` class.

## What is a Dataclass?

- Introduced in Python 3.7 via the `dataclasses` module.
- Simplifies class definitions that primarily store data.
- Automatically generates methods like `__init__()`, `__repr__()`, and `__eq__()`.
- Reduces boilerplate code and improves readability.

## Purpose of the `Agent` Class

The `Agent` class holds key information such as:

- Agent’s **name** (e.g., "Assistant")
- System **instructions** or prompt guiding the agent’s behavior
- The **model** (LLM) the agent uses for generating responses
- Optional attributes like memory, tools, and context

It primarily acts as a **structured data container**.

## Why Use `@dataclass` for the `Agent` Class?

### 1. Cleaner & Concise Code

```python
@dataclass
class Agent:
    name: str
    instructions: str
    model: Any
